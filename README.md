# Ansible-playbooks_and_ad-hoc-commands

## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to define and manage infrastructure as code. It uses a simple and human-readable language to describe tasks and configurations, making it easy to automate repetitive tasks, deploy applications, and manage system configurations.

This repository serves as a collection of Ansible playbooks and ad-hoc commands that can be used for a wide range of purposes, including provisioning servers, configuring network devices, deploying applications, and more. 
These resources are intended to provide practical examples and serve as a starting point for automating your own infrastructure.

## Playbooks
The playbooks directory contains a collection of Ansible playbooks that automate different tasks. 
Each playbook is designed to perform a specific function, such as server provisioning, application deployment, or system configuration. 
Refer to the individual playbook's documentation for detailed instructions on usage and customization.

## Ad-Hoc Commands
The ad-hoc-commands directory contains a set of ad-hoc commands that can be run directly from the command line without the need for a playbook. 
These commands provide quick and one-time actions to be performed on remote systems. 
Detailed instructions for using each ad-hoc command can be found in their respective documentation.
